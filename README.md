#jsmart-timing

A sophisticated timing framework for Java 8. It provides a lot of low level control over timing such as being able to specify whether to take an average with a specified tolerance, take the minimum out of a large set, etc. It additionally provides controls over whether to include data points in which the garbage collector was active or provides tools to the programmer to ensure that timed code is not optimized away by the compiler.
